# PF2e Statblocks for Obsidian

Use Markdown syntax to create great-looking Pathfinder Second Edition statblocks inside of Obsidian!

## Usage

To start an item block, create a codeblock with the language tag `pf2e-stats`, as shown:

    ```pf2e-stats
    [YOUR CONTENT HERE]
    ```

### Name

The name of the item/creature/etc is indicated with heading 1, prefixed with a single hash `#`.

### Level

The type of statblock and the item/creature/etc level is indicated with heading 2, prefixed with a double hash `##`.

### Traits

In a standard statblock, traits are signified by wrapping them in double-equals `==`, as below:

```
==Unique== ==Medium== ==Humanoid==
```

**Note:** Rarity and size tags currently do not get their specific coloration.

For abbreviated statblocks, such as the ones for brief NPC blurbs, instead use heading 3, prefixed with a triple hash `###`

### Line Breaks

To reset indentation, do two line breaks after a line.

### Dividers

Horizontal lines (three hyphens `---`) can be added to break up the sections of a statblock.

### Action Icons

You can add action icons as follows:

- One action: `` `[one-action]` ``
- Two-action activity: `` `[two-actions]` ``
- Three-action activity: `` `[three-actions]` ``
- Free action: `` `[free-action]` ``
- Reaction: `` `[reaction]` ``
